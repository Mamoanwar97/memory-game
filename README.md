# Memory Game Project

it is a mini game where there is 8 pairs of flipped cards. and you try to match them together in shortest time and least moves.

there is also a starts rating which depends on your no. of moves so be careful everymove counts :D 

there is also a reset button if you wanted to retry.

when you win your no of moves and time taken is displayed. there is also a play again button to have more fun. ;)
